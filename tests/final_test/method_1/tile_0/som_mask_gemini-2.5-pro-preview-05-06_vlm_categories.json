    "category": "Tree cover",
    "confidence": "Medium",
    "reasoning": "The very dark green color and occurrence as linear features or dense patches suggest woody vegetation like trees or dense shrubs along boundaries/waterways."
  },

    "category": "Cropland",
    "confidence": "High",
    "reasoning": "Rectangular shapes, colors (browns for soil/residue, dark greens for crops) are characteristic of active agricultural land use."
  },
  "2": {
    "category": "Cropland",
    "confidence": "High",
    "reasoning": "The regular geometric shapes (fields) and colors (greens for growing crops, browns for fallow/harvested) strongly indicate cropland."
  },
  "3": {
    "category": "Built-up",
    "confidence": "Medium",
    "reasoning": "The presence of a clear settlement (buildings, roads in upper left) and major road lines are strong indicators of built-up areas."
  },
  "4": {
    "category": "Grassland",
    "confidence": "Medium",
    "reasoning": "Large areas of bright, lush green vegetation, some with natural-looking boundaries, suggest grassland or pasture, distinct from typical row crops."
  },
  "5": {
    "category": "Bare / sparse vegetation",
    "confidence": "High",
    "reasoning": "Very light brown/tan colors and smooth texture strongly indicate exposed soil or very sparse, dry vegetation, typical of fallow or harvested land."
  },
  "6": {
    "category": "Cropland",
    "confidence": "High",
    "reasoning": "Distinct rectangular field shapes with bright, uniform colors (including unusual reds and bright greens) indicate actively managed agricultural plots with specific crops."
