    "category": "Tree cover",
    "confidence": "Medium",
    "reasoning": "Irregular patterns and varied green shades suggest natural vegetation, likely trees. Mottled texture indicates canopy variation typical of forest areas."

    "category": "Cropland",
    "confidence": "High",
    "reasoning": "Geometric field patterns, regular shapes, and varying colors indicate agricultural use. Circular patterns suggest pivot irrigation systems."
  },
  "2": {
    "category": "Built-up",
    "confidence": "High",
    "reasoning": "High reflectivity and geometric patterns are characteristic of urban areas. Sharp contrast with surrounding vegetation supports this classification."
  },
  "3": {
    "category": "Permanent water bodies",
    "confidence": "High",
    "reasoning": "Dark color, linear shape, and consistent width strongly suggest a river or canal. Straight path indicates it may be man-made."
  },
  "4": {
    "category": "Cropland",
    "confidence": "High",
    "reasoning": "Circular shapes indicative of center pivot irrigation systems. Uniformity and contrast with surrounding fields support cropland classification."
  },
  "5": {
    "category": "Shrubland",
    "confidence": "Medium",
    "reasoning": "Mix of irregular and geometric shapes suggests transition zone. Varied textures indicate diverse vegetation, likely shrubs."
  },
  "6": {
    "category": "Grassland",
    "confidence": "Medium",
    "reasoning": "Uniform texture and lighter color suggest herbaceous vegetation. Lack of clear field patterns differentiates it from cropland."
  },
  "7": {
    "category": "Bare / sparse vegetation",
    "confidence": "Medium",
    "reasoning": "High reflectivity suggests exposed soil or rock. Small, scattered nature indicates areas of sparse vegetation."
  },
  "8": {
    "category": "Tree cover",
    "confidence": "Low",
    "reasoning": "Small, scattered dark spots could be individual trees or small clusters within agricultural landscape. Potential confusion with shadows."
  },
  "9": {
    "category": "Permanent water bodies",
    "confidence": "Medium",
    "reasoning": "Linear shape and connection to main water body suggest smaller streams or irrigation channels. Lighter color may indicate shallower water."
  },
  "10": {
    "category": "Herbaceous wetland",
    "confidence": "Low",
    "reasoning": "Irregular shapes and proximity to water suggest wetland areas. Darker green indicates denser vegetation. Potential confusion with other types."
