    "category": "Permanent water bodies",
    "confidence": "High",
    "reasoning": "Large, dark expanse with smooth texture and clear boundaries against land masses strongly indicates a large water body, likely a sea or lake."
  },

    "category": "Cropland",
    "confidence": "High",
    "reasoning": "Distinct rectangular shapes with varying shades of green are characteristic of agricultural fields in different stages of growth or with different crops."
  },
  "2": {
    "category": "Grassland",
    "confidence": "Medium",
    "reasoning": "Bright green color suggests vegetation, but lack of clear field patterns differentiates it from cropland. Could be natural or managed grassland areas."
  },
  "3": {
    "category": "Tree cover",
    "confidence": "Medium",
    "reasoning": "Darker green color and rougher texture suggest denser vegetation, likely small forested areas or tree lines between fields. Resolution limits detailed confirmation."
  },
  "4": {
    "category": "Built-up",
    "confidence": "High",
    "reasoning": "Small, bright white patches clustered together are characteristic of buildings and urban infrastructure, indicating a built-up area or small town."
  },
  "5": {
    "category": "Shrubland",
    "confidence": "Low",
    "reasoning": "Color and texture suggest vegetation denser than grassland but less dense than forest. Difficult to distinguish from other vegetation types at this resolution."
  },
  "6": {
    "category": "Bare / sparse vegetation",
    "confidence": "Medium",
    "reasoning": "Light color and smooth texture suggest areas with little to no vegetation. Could be bare soil, sandy areas, or areas with very sparse vegetation cover."
