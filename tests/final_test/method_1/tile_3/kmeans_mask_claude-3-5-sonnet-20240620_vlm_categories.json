    "confidence": "High",
    "reasoning": "Dark, smooth texture and clear contrast with surrounding land strongly indicate a large river or water body."

    "category": "Herbaceous wetland",
    "confidence": "Medium",
    "reasoning": "Bright green color, proximity to water, and irregular patterns suggest wetland vegetation. Varied textures indicate possible seasonal flooding or mixed vegetation."

    "category": "Cropland",
    "confidence": "High",
    "reasoning": "Regular geometric patterns and varying colors are characteristic of agricultural fields in different stages of growth or with different crops."
  },
  "3": {
    "category": "Built-up",
    "confidence": "Medium",
    "reasoning": "Light color and contrast with vegetation suggest man-made structures. Mix of geometric and irregular shapes indicates possible urban or suburban development."
  },

    "category": "Tree cover",
    "confidence": "Medium",
    "reasoning": "Dark green color and smooth texture suggest dense vegetation. Irregular shapes and location near water bodies indicate possible forested areas."
  },
  "5": {
    "category": "Bare / sparse vegetation",
    "confidence": "Medium",
    "reasoning": "Light color and rough texture suggest areas with little vegetation. Could be naturally occurring bare areas or land cleared for development."
  },
  "6": {
    "category": "Shrubland",
    "confidence": "Low",
    "reasoning": "Mixed appearance and transitional nature suggest areas of mixed vegetation. Could be shrubland, degraded forest, or mix of grassland and sparse trees."
