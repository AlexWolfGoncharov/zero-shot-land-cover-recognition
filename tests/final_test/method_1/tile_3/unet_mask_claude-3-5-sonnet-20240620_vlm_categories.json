    "confidence": "High",
    "reasoning": "Geometric shapes and regular patterns within each plot typical of agricultural fields. Different colors likely represent various crops or growth stages."

    "confidence": "High",
    "reasoning": "Regular grid pattern and light color characteristic of urban areas. Contrast with surrounding vegetation supports this classification."

    "category": "Herbaceous wetland",
    "confidence": "Medium",
    "reasoning": "Location within water body and dark green color suggest wetland vegetation. Smooth texture indicates herbaceous rather than woody plants."
  },

    "category": "Bare / sparse vegetation",
    "confidence": "Medium",
    "reasoning": "Light color and irregular shapes suggest areas with little vegetation. Could be fallow fields or naturally sparse areas between croplands."

    "category": "Built-up",
    "confidence": "Medium",
    "reasoning": "Very light color and straight boundaries suggest man-made structures or cleared areas within urban zones. Possibly large buildings or infrastructure."
