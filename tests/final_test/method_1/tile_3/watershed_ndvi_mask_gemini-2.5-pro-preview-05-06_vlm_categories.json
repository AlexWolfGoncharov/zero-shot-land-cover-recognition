    "category": "Cropland",
    "confidence": "Medium",
    "reasoning": "Regular, grid-like patterns of very dark green suggest intensively cultivated, possibly flooded/irrigated crops (e.g., mature rice), sharing spectral similarities with included natural wetland vegetation."

  "1": {
    "category": "Bare / sparse vegetation",
    "confidence": "High",
    "reasoning": "Light color (high albedo) and smooth texture suggest exposed soil, sandbars, or areas with minimal vegetation cover, typical for this category."
  },
  "2": {
    "category": "Permanent water bodies",
    "confidence": "High",
    "reasoning": "Very dark, smooth appearance in RGB, forming distinct river channels and open water surfaces, characteristic of permanent water."
  },
  "3": {
    "category": "Cropland",
    "confidence": "High",
    "reasoning": "Field-like shapes, green color indicating active vegetation, and context within an agricultural mosaic strongly suggest actively cultivated land."
