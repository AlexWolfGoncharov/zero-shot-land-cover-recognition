    "category": "Bare / sparse vegetation",
    "confidence": "Medium",
    "reasoning": "Extremely light color suggests exposed soil or bare ground. Could be fallow fields or recently harvested cropland."

    "category": "Cropland",
    "confidence": "High",
    "reasoning": "Green color and geometric shapes consistent with agricultural fields. Slight texture variation suggests different crop types or growth stages."
