    "category": "Bare / sparse vegetation",
    "confidence": "medium",
    "reasoning": "Sparse, patchy cover and irregular shapes suggest fallow or bare ground, not built-up due to lack of urban structure."

    "category": "Built-up",
    "confidence": "high",
    "reasoning": "The blocky, high-contrast pattern and road adjacency are characteristic of urban or built-up areas."

    "confidence": "medium",
    "reasoning": "The rough, mixed texture and peripheral location suggest unmanaged grassland or pasture."

    "category": "Tree cover",
    "confidence": "medium",

    "category": "Bare / sparse vegetation",
    "confidence": "high",
    "reasoning": "The absence of vegetation and very light color indicate bare soil or recently disturbed ground."
