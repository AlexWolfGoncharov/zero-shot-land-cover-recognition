    "confidence": "High",
    "reasoning": "Maintained field geometry with lighter green/yellowish coloration suggests cropland at early growth stage or different cultivation practices."

    "confidence": "Medium",
    "reasoning": "Maintained field boundaries with minimal vegetation indicate agricultural land in fallow or post-harvest state within farming rotation."

    "category": "Bare/sparse vegetation",
    "confidence": "Medium",
    "reasoning": "Extremely light coloration with high reflectance within agricultural matrix indicates exposed soil with minimal vegetation but still within managed landscape."

    "confidence": "High",
    "reasoning": "Extremely bright reflectance with rectangular geometries and non-natural appearance indicate human-made structures and developed areas."
