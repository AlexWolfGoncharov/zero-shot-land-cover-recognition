    "category": "Bare / sparse vegetation",
    "confidence": "Medium",
    "reasoning": "Lighter coloration (pale yellow to light brown) suggests areas with less vegetation cover. Could be fallow fields or areas with sparse vegetation."

    "category": "Built-up",
    "confidence": "High",
    "reasoning": "Bright, reflective areas with defined geometric shapes. Small size suggests settlements or agricultural buildings within rural landscape."

    "confidence": "Medium",
    "reasoning": "Dark green, irregularly shaped areas with textured appearance. Likely small patches of trees or woodlands interspersed within agricultural landscape."

    "category": "Cropland",
    "confidence": "High",
    "reasoning": "Regular geometric shapes with medium to dark green coloration. Indicates cultivated fields, possibly different crop types or growth stages than cluster 0."

    "category": "Grassland",
    "confidence": "Low",
    "reasoning": "Light to medium green areas with mottled texture and irregular shapes. Could be natural grassland or pasture, but also possibly fallow cropland."

    "confidence": "Low",
    "reasoning": "Very dark, linear features. Possibly small water channels or irrigation ditches, but could also be roads or other infrastructure."
