    "confidence": "high",
    "reasoning": "The geometric shape and uniform dark color of these areas in the RGB image are characteristic of agricultural fields with active vegetation."

  "3": {
    "category": "Cropland",
    "confidence": "high",
    "reasoning": "The prevalence of rectangular fields with uniform color and texture strongly indicates agricultural land, likely representing a specific crop type or growth stage."

    "category": "Built-up",
    "confidence": "high",
    "reasoning": "The dense, heterogeneous pattern of buildings, roads, and interspersed vegetation in the RGB image is clearly indicative of a built-up area or dense rural settlement."

  "5": {
    "category": "Bare / sparse vegetation",
    "confidence": "high",
    "reasoning": "The light brown/yellowish color and uniform texture in both fields and circular areas suggest bare soil or very sparse, dry vegetation."
  },
  "6": {
    "category": "Bare / sparse vegetation",
    "confidence": "high",
    "reasoning": "The very light brown/white color and uniform texture in rectangular fields are characteristic of bare soil or very sparse, dry vegetation, likely fallow or recently harvested land."
