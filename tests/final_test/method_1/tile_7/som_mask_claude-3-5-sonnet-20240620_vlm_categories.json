    "category": "Cropland",
    "confidence": "High",
    "reasoning": "Regular geometric patterns and varying colors indicate different crops or fields at various growth stages, typical of agricultural land use."
  },
  "1": {
    "category": "Tree cover",
    "confidence": "High",
    "reasoning": "Dark green color, smooth texture, and irregular shapes are characteristic of forested areas or dense tree cover."
  },
  "2": {
    "category": "Built-up",
    "confidence": "High",
    "reasoning": "Grid-like pattern of small rectangles strongly suggests an urban or suburban area with buildings and streets."
  },
  "3": {
    "category": "Permanent water bodies",
    "confidence": "High",
    "reasoning": "Dark color, smooth texture, and sinuous shape are typical of rivers or streams. The abrupt change in adjacent land cover supports this interpretation."
  },
  "4": {
    "category": "Bare / sparse vegetation",
    "confidence": "Medium",
    "reasoning": "Light color suggests exposed soil, possibly fallow fields or areas with little vegetation. Medium confidence due to potential confusion with very light crops."
  },
  "5": {
    "category": "Grassland",
    "confidence": "Medium",
    "reasoning": "Varied green tones suggest grass or low vegetation. Less structured than cropland, but not as dense as tree cover."
  },
  "6": {
    "category": "Bare / sparse vegetation",
    "confidence": "High",
    "reasoning": "Extremely bright appearance suggests bare soil, possibly recently harvested or plowed fields. Clear boundaries indicate human activity, likely part of agricultural cycles."
