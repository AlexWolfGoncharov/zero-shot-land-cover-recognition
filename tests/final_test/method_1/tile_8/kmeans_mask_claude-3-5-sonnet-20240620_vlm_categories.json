    "reasoning": "Darker green and irregular shapes suggest natural vegetation. Likely forested areas or windbreaks between agricultural lands."
  },

    "category": "Bare / sparse vegetation",
    "confidence": "Medium",
    "reasoning": "High reflectance suggests bare soil or sand. Circular shape indicates human influence, possibly fallow fields or land cleared for future crops."

    "category": "Permanent water bodies",
    "confidence": "High",
    "reasoning": "Dark color, smooth texture, and curved shape are characteristic of a water body, likely a lake or reservoir."

    "category": "Built-up",
    "confidence": "Medium",
    "reasoning": "Bright reflectance and geometric shapes suggest man-made structures. Likely farm buildings, roads, or small settlements within the agricultural landscape."

    "confidence": "Low",
    "reasoning": "Color and pattern suggest natural vegetation, but not as dark as tree cover. Could be natural grasslands or pastures used for grazing."
