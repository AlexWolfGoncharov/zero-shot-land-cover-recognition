    "category": "Permanent water bodies",
    "confidence": "High",
    "reasoning": "Very dark color, smooth texture, and characteristic shape strongly suggest an open water body like a lake or reservoir."
  },
  "1": {
    "category": "Cropland",
    "confidence": "High",
    "reasoning": "Regular geometric shapes and context within an agricultural area indicate actively managed cropland, including vegetated and fallow/tilled stages."
  },
  "2": {
    "category": "Cropland",
    "confidence": "High",
    "reasoning": "Distinct circular shapes are unequivocal evidence of center-pivot irrigation systems. Green color indicates active crop growth."
  },
  "3": {
    "category": "Cropland",
    "confidence": "Medium",
    "reasoning": "Agricultural patterns (circles, rectangles, tilling) are evident. Varied colors suggest different crop stages or fallow land, consistent with cropland."
  },
  "4": {
    "category": "Cropland",
    "confidence": "Medium",
    "reasoning": "Clear agricultural shapes (circles, rectangles) indicate cropland. Lighter colors suggest different crop types, harvested fields, or fallow land."
  },
  "5": {
    "category": "Cropland",
    "confidence": "Medium",
    "reasoning": "Distinct circular agricultural patterns indicate cropland. Very light color suggests fallow, harvested, or recently tilled fields (part of cropland)."
  },
  "6": {
    "category": "Built-up",
    "confidence": "Medium",
    "reasoning": "Prominent area shows settlement features (streets, buildings). Linear bright features are consistent with roads, fitting the 'Built-up' category."
