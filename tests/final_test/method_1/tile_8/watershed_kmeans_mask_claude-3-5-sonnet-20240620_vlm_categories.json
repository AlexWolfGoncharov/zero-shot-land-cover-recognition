  "0": {
    "category": "Cropland",
    "confidence": "High",
    "reasoning": "Regular geometric shapes, uniform texture, and dark green color strongly suggest cultivated crops in active growth stage."
  },
  "1": {
    "category": "Cropland",
    "confidence": "High",
    "reasoning": "Circular patterns characteristic of center-pivot irrigation systems. Light color suggests harvested or fallow fields."
  },
  "2": {
    "category": "Cropland",
    "confidence": "High",
    "reasoning": "Geometric shape and light green color indicate agricultural fields, likely in early growth stage or with different crop types."
  },
  "3": {
    "category": "Cropland",
    "confidence": "High",
    "reasoning": "Rectangular shape and medium green color suggest agricultural fields with crops in a different growth stage or type."
  },
  "4": {
    "category": "Cropland",
    "confidence": "Medium",
    "reasoning": "Very dark color and geometric shape suggest dense crop coverage or possibly different crop type. Lack of visible canopy texture."
  },
  "5": {
    "category": "Cropland",
    "confidence": "High",
    "reasoning": "Light color and geometric shape indicate agricultural fields, likely harvested or fallow. Consistent with other observed patterns."
  },
  "6": {
    "category": "Permanent water bodies",
    "confidence": "High",
    "reasoning": "Blue-green color and irregular shape strongly suggest a water body, likely a lake or large pond within agricultural landscape."
  },
  "7": {
    "category": "Built-up",
    "confidence": "Medium",
    "reasoning": "Small size, regular spacing, and association with field boundaries suggest farm buildings or rural structures."
  },
  "8": {
    "category": "Bare / sparse vegetation",
    "confidence": "Medium",
    "reasoning": "Thin linear features likely represent roads or field boundaries. Darker color suggests bare soil or sparse vegetation."
  },
  "9": {
    "category": "Tree cover",
    "confidence": "Low",
    "reasoning": "Less geometric shape and darker green color suggest possible tree cover. Difficult to distinguish from dense crops."
  },
  "10": {
    "category": "Built-up",
    "confidence": "Low",
    "reasoning": "Very small, scattered dark spots within circular fields. Could be structures or equipment, but low resolution limits confidence."
