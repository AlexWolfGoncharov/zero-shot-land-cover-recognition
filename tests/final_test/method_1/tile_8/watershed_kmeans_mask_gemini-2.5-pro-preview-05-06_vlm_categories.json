    "category": "Cropland",
    "confidence": "High",
    "reasoning": "Circular shapes indicate agricultural use (irrigation); brown/tan colors suggest fallow, harvested, or recently tilled land within a crop cycle."

  "4": {
    "category": "Cropland",
    "confidence": "Medium",
    "reasoning": "Geometric (rectangular) and irregular shapes, mixed vegetation states, and adjacency to other croplands suggest dryland farming or fallow agricultural land."
  },
  "5": {
    "category": "Cropland",
    "confidence": "High",
    "reasoning": "Obvious circular shapes from center-pivot irrigation, with visible vegetation cover, likely representing different crop types or growth stages."

  "6": {
    "category": "Built-up",
    "confidence": "High",
    "reasoning": "Presence of gridded street patterns, small structures resembling rooftops, and dense arrangement typical of a human settlement or town."

  "7": {
    "category": "Cropland",
    "confidence": "High",
    "reasoning": "Geometric shapes (rectangular) and context within an agricultural area strongly suggest fallow, harvested, or recently tilled cropland."
  },
  "8": {
    "category": "Bare / sparse vegetation",
    "confidence": "Medium",
    "reasoning": "Irregular shapes, predominantly light brown/tan colors with minimal green, suggesting low vegetation cover, not clearly cultivated or dense grassland."
  },
  "9": {
    "category": "Bare / sparse vegetation",
    "confidence": "High",
    "reasoning": "Very bright, light tan/whitish appearance, often along water edges (shoreline), indicating exposed soil, sand, or very dry sparse vegetation."

    "category": "Cropland",
    "confidence": "High",
    "reasoning": "Predominantly rectangular field patterns, mixed green and brown colors indicating various crop stages or fallow land within an extensive agricultural landscape."
