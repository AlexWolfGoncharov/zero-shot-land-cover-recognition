    "confidence": "High",
    "reasoning": "Regular geometric patterns, varied colors, and clear field boundaries typical of agricultural land use. Mix of circular and rectangular fields suggests different irrigation methods."

    "category": "Cropland",
    "confidence": "High",
    "reasoning": "Perfect circular shapes indicative of center-pivot irrigation systems. Uniform color within each circle suggests single crop cultivation."

    "category": "Tree cover",
    "confidence": "Medium",
    "reasoning": "Darker green color and irregular shape suggest natural vegetation. Limited extent and proximity to cropland could indicate managed woodlots or riparian zones."

    "category": "Permanent water bodies",
    "confidence": "High",
    "reasoning": "Reflective surface, smooth texture, and distinct color difference from surrounding land strongly indicate a water body, likely an irrigation reservoir or natural lake."
