  "0": {
    "category": "Bare / sparse vegetation",
    "confidence": "High",
    "reasoning": "Very high reflectance (bright white/tan) and smooth texture suggest dry, bare soil, sand, or possibly salt flats with minimal vegetation."
  },
  "1": {
    "category": "Grassland",
    "confidence": "Medium",
    "reasoning": "Light tan/brown, mottled texture. Appears as sparse or dry herbaceous cover (grassland), distinguishing it from the more barren Cluster 0."
  },
  "2": {
    "category": "Cropland",
    "confidence": "Medium",
    "reasoning": "Rectangular shapes in top-right suggest fallow/harvested cropland. Central patches could be dry grassland. Cropland is a significant component."
  },
  "3": {
    "category": "Grassland",
    "confidence": "Medium",
    "reasoning": "Greenish hue, moderately rough texture in large central natural patches suggest herbaceous cover (grassland). Some agricultural fields share this signature."
  },
  "4": {
    "category": "Tree cover",
    "confidence": "High",
    "reasoning": "Dark green, coarse texture in large, regular rectangular blocks (bottom-right) strongly indicates managed tree plantations."
  },
  "5": {
    "category": "Permanent water bodies",
    "confidence": "High",
    "reasoning": "Clearly corresponds to dark, smooth water surfaces in aquaculture ponds (top-left) and other small water bodies. Very low reflectance."
  },
  "6": {
    "category": "Built-up",
    "confidence": "Low",
    "reasoning": "Corresponds to very dark linear features (banks/paths in aquaculture) and patches (shadows/small water). 'Built-up' for artificial linear structures is a possibility."
