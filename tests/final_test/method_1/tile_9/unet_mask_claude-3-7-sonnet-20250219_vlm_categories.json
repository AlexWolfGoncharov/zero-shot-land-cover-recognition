  "1": {
    "category": "Shrubland",
    "confidence": "medium",
    "reasoning": "Mixed tan with scattered darker vegetation patches; discontinuous plant cover forming transitional zone between bare areas and denser vegetation."

    "category": "Cropland",
    "confidence": "high",
    "reasoning": "Regular geometric patterns with rectangular fields, uniform vegetation within parcels, clear field boundaries indicating cultivated areas."
  },
  "3": {
    "category": "Tree cover",
    "confidence": "medium",
    "reasoning": "Dark green homogeneous texture, denser vegetation than surrounding areas, lacks agricultural geometric patterns, suggesting natural woody vegetation."
  },
  "4": {
    "category": "Grassland",
    "confidence": "medium",
    "reasoning": "Intermediate vegetation density with mixed green and tan coloration, irregular patterns suggesting natural grassy cover with scattered vegetation."
  },
  "5": {
    "category": "Built-up",
    "confidence": "high",
    "reasoning": "Small bright white patches with high reflectance, geometric shapes, sharp contrast with surrounding vegetation indicating artificial structures."

    "confidence": "high",
    "reasoning": "Very dark/black patches with distinct boundaries, associated with agricultural areas, suggesting irrigation ponds or small reservoirs."
