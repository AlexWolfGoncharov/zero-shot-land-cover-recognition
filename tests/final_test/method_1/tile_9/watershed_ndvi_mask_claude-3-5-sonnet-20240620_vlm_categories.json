    "category": "Bare / sparse vegetation",
    "confidence": "High",
    "reasoning": "Light color, sandy texture, and lack of visible vegetation indicate bare or sparsely vegetated land, typical of arid environments."
  },
  "1": {
    "category": "Shrubland",
    "confidence": "Medium",
    "reasoning": "Mixed appearance suggests transition from bare to vegetated areas. Scattered vegetation patterns consistent with shrubland in semi-arid regions."
  },
  "2": {
    "category": "Tree cover",
    "confidence": "Medium",
    "reasoning": "Darker green color and rougher texture suggest denser vegetation, likely including trees. Coverage not entirely uniform, indicating possible mixed types."
  },
  "3": {
    "category": "Cropland",
    "confidence": "High",
    "reasoning": "Regular geometric patterns and varying shades of green characteristic of agricultural fields. Grid-like structure strongly indicates human-managed cropland."
